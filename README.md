The idea for creating a crowd-sourced wifi directory for the community of Salinas came as a response to the lack of access to reliable home internet. During the pandemic, this need became amplified as people transitioned to a virtual-first format for everyday services and activities. This crowd-sourced app allows users to view local public spaces that offer free wifi. If users wish to contribute a location and its details, they can log in using their Google account.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJs, MongoDB, Express, Whimsical, Git, GitHub.


Getting Started:If a user wishes to view wifi locations and their details, there is no need to log in since locations, and their details are viewable to everyone. However, if users wish to contribute by adding a place or leaving a comment, they must sign in using their Google account. 


This app can benefit from implementing a mobile-first approach that can be readable and easy to load on a mobile phone browser. Also, adding a map API such as leaflet or Google Maps can improve the user experience by adding a visual map component. Lastly, I think this directory can be included as a feature to a more extensive crowd-sourced guide that offers information regarding services such as affordable housing and food access.
